                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! My name is Sri Krishna, and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Electronics and Communication in Sri Eshwar College of Engineering . I have always been fascinated by how electronic devices communicate with each other and the potential applications they hold in various industries.</p>
                <p>My passion for understanding the intricacies of electronics goes hand in hand with my interest in robotics and machine learning. Exploring the field of robotics and machine learning allows me to apply my knowledge in electronics to create intelligent systems that can perceive, learn, and interact with the world around them.</p>
                <p>Throughout my academic journey, I've been involved in projects that blend my skills in electronics and communication with robotics and machine learning. Whether it's designing circuitry for sensor modules, implementing algorithms for robotic perception, or exploring machine learning techniques for autonomous systems, I thrive on the challenges and possibilities that arise in this interdisciplinary field.</p>

            <h3>Tethered drone for Firefighting</h3>
            <p>In fire-fighting operations, limited flight time and power supply constraints pose significant challenges to traditional drones, hindering their effectiveness and efficiency. The inability to sustain prolonged aerial surveillance, assess rapidly evolving fire conditions, and provide real-time situational awareness severely limits the capabilities of current drone technology in firefighting scenarios.</p>
            <p>Traditional drones face limitations in fire-fighting operations due to limited flight time and power supply. To overcome these challenges, our proposed solution is tethered drones. These drones use a power and communication tether connected to a ground station, providing continuous power and extended flight time. Tethered drones offer enhanced situational awareness through real-time video feeds and data transmission, enabling accurate fire assessment and hotspot identification. They also provide stability in challenging conditions and allow for precision operations. Safety measures, such as flame-resistant materials and trained operators, ensure safe operation. Implementing tethered drones in firefighting can revolutionize the industry, improving effectiveness, efficiency, and safety to save lives and protect assets.</p>
